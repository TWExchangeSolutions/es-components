# Migration Guide: v18 => v19

There are significant breaking changes in version 19 of ES Components. This is largely an attempt to reduce the surface area of component APIs while increasing also increasing flexibility.

## Dependency Updates

The following peerDependency updates have been made:

`styled-components@4`
`react@16.8`
`react-dom@16.8`

All components have been updated to use React's new [hooks API](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

The `peerDependency` for `moment` has been removed and can be removed from downstream projects.

## Component API Updates

With the transition of components within this library, it made sense to make additional breaking changes to try and reduce complexity of some components.

### Notification

The Notification component has a smaller set of props and allows downstream projects to have more control over how to render it. There are also three different implementations of `Notification` for each variant (**light** and **message only**).

The `header` and `additionalText` props have been removed and `Notification` will now render all children. `Message` and `InlineMessage` components have been and can be used to achieve the same effect as `header` and `additionalText` used to provide.

`callsToAction` no longer exist as part of the `Notification` api. In order to create this type of notification, use the ` CallToAction` component found in the [Patterns](https://wtw-im.github.io/es-components/#patterns) section.

### Buttons


### Forms

Form controls now share a common component for spacing, orientation, and validation state. All form components should be wrapped with a `Control` component.

#### Control

A `Control` component controls spacing, orientation, and validation state of its children.

#### Label

Use a `Label` component for any form controls except for `RadioButton` and `Checkbox` components. A `Label` has no props will render children and is solely used for styling purposes.

#### AdditionalHelp

An `AdditionalHelp` component can be used to provide context for a specific `Control`. It will receive appropriate styling as long as it is within a `Control` component.

#### Dropdown

A `Dropdown` no longer has required props and will pass any props to the underlying `select` element.

#### Checkbox

A `Checkbox` no longer has required props and will pass any props to the underlying `input` element. The `Checkbox` will render a label with any children of the `Checkbox` component.

#### Textbox

A `Textbox` is no longer responsible for creating a corresponding `label`. All of the required props have been removed and any props that are included will propagate to the `input` element.

#### RadioGroup and RadioButton

A `RadioGroup` is now responsible only for displaying all of its child components. It propagates any props down to each child component, so an `onChange` prop can be added to the `RadioGroup` component and it will be set on each `RadioButton` component.

`RadioButtton` will render any children in it's corresponding `label`. `RadioButton` components no longer have any required props. It will receive event handlers directly from it's parent `RadioGroup` component. `disabled` and `checked` props on a `RadioButton` will render the UI accordingly. `checked` gets passed down from the `RadioGroup` component based on whether or not the value of the `RadioButton` matches the `selectedValue` prop on the `RadioGroup`.

### DatePicker

The `DatePicker` has been updated to no longer require a `moment` object. It now operates with the native JavaScript `Date` object. Dates can be manipulated using a library like `date-fns` if necessary.
